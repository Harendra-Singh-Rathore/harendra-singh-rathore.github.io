  <section class="about-text">
    <p>
      I am a Senior iOS Developer with over 6 years of experience, passionate about building intuitive, scalable, and high-performance mobile applications. Throughout my career, I have designed, developed, and delivered more than 20+ applications across industries, always with a focus on clean architecture, performance optimization, and delivering seamless user experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      My technical expertise includes Swift, UIKit, SwiftUI, MVVM, REST API integration, and performance tuning with Xcode Instruments. I also have hands-on experience with Firebase, Git-based workflows, and modern frameworks such as Combine, WebRTC, and React Native. More recently, I've expanded my skill set to include React Native development for cross-platform mobile applications and Ruby on Rails for web development. This diverse skill set allows me to adapt quickly to complex requirements and implement innovative solutions across multiple platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      I thrive in Agile environments that value collaboration, ownership, and continuous improvement. Mentoring junior developers and contributing to team growth are aspects of my role I deeply enjoy, as I believe strong teams are the foundation of successful projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of work, I stay curious by experimenting with side projects, exploring Apple's latest technologies, React Native ecosystem, and Ruby on Rails development. I'm constantly engaging with emerging trends to expand my creativity and technical expertise across multiple platforms and technologies.
